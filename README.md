Feel free to continue developing this bot!

[Update March 2022]: Developement of Reggin stopped

[Info]: The token in the commits is not valid, don't worry

## How to run:
-Download Repo  
-`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  
-Insert your code in the main file `reggin.py`  
-`python3 reggin.py`  

## Important note:
The code is based on old versions of [interactions.py](https://discord-interactions.readthedocs.io/en/legacy-v3/quickstart.html) and [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.3/) so it may not work in the future without changes!
